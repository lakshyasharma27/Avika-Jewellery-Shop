<b style="font-size: larger;">Care Guide :</b>&nbsp; 
<p> <li>The group derives its origins from textile retailing and wholesaling and has an experience of over 100 years in the trade. Avika branched out into the field of Jewellery retailing in the year 1993 &nbsp; by opening its first store in Udaipur. 
The reason behind the Avika group's foray into business itself is quite unique and makes it interesting to read. The ancestors of the current management come from a previous background that comprised of priests, saints and advisors to kings. Hailing from the Udaipur district of Rajasthan.<li></p>
<p>Since 1971, AVIKA has established and maintained the highest standards in design, materials and crafts manship With some simple, basic care you can help preserve and protect your jewellery for years to come.<li></p>
<p>All jewellery is fragile and requires proper care. Water, dust, pollution, seawater, natural body oils, chemicals and daily wear can affect natural stones and precious metals.<li></p>
<p>We recommend you examine your jewellery regularly to make sure settings are snug and clasps and joints are secure.<li></p>
<p>Sterling Silver tarnishes over time, especially when exposed to salt air and products containing sulphur, such as rubber bands and some types of paper. Tarnishing and any dullness, can be removed with a non-abrasive silver polishing cloth.<li></p>
<p>Pearl Jewellery can be cleaned with a slightly damp cloth and care should be taken to keep it free from perfumes, cosmetics and chemicals.If you wear your pearls regularly, or other strung items, we encourage you to have them checked and restrung annually.<li></p>
<p>When not wearing your jewellery, we recommend that you place the piece back in its original case or another suitably lined box or pouch to avoid scratching and tangling with other pieces.<li></p>
<p>To protect marcasite jewellery, care should be taken to avoid getting the stones wet. The best way to clean marcasite jewellery is simply to wipe the surface with a damp cloth then dry it with a soft, dry cloth. Make sure the item is thoroughly dry before storing it.<li></p>
<p>To care and maintain your AVIKA leather handbags, you should wipe off spots and spills promptly with a slightly damp cloth. About four times a year, apply a coat of leather conditioner and buff back to mint condition.<li></p>
<p>Finally, never store leather handbags in plastic bags. Leather needs to breath. Store your leather handbags in light weight cotton bags.</p>
