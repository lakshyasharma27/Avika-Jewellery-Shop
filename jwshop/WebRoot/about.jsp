<li><b style="font-size: larger;">CMD's Message : </b><br>&nbsp;</>
"I am an old fashioned man. when i was told of the need of avika jewellers to reach out to the world through a website. I realised how much the world has changed from the day I used to sit in my shop in udaipur.
I used to know almost all of my customers on a first name basis. I used to know about their family backgrounds, would discuss personal problems and attend all the functions in their households.
when your association with your customer is at that level you automatically want to give him the best product at the best price. 
cheating was never an option no matter how minimal or however lucrative the benefits might seen.
business  becomes almost a partnership with your customer. this is the principle on which i have tried to build this group. when i see how many competitors function and how they treat their customers, i am inspired even further to stick of my principles in every walk of business. To anyone who
does business with avika jewellers, whether it be the customers,the vendors, the employees or others institutions, I can assure you of one thing - Avika will always uphold the principles of fairness with everybody we do business with, at all times.
It is in our blood. It's the only way my forefathers have known and that was the only way taught to me".
